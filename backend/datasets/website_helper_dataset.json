  {
    "instruction": "How do I feature the tribute on social media without sharing the link?",
    "response": "You could share a screenshot of the tribute with a message like 'Honoring [Name] - link in bio' or send via DM. But sharing the actual link gives people the full experience."
  },
  {
    "instruction": "Can providers offer discounts or promotions?",
    "response": "Yes, providers can set their own pricing and promotions. Some offer early booking discounts, package deals, or seasonal pricing. Check individual provider listings for current offers."
  },
  {
    "instruction": "What if I want to add a poem or eulogy?",
    "response": "Perfect for the biography section. Write or paste the poem/eulogy there. You can format it with line breaks and spacing to make it look beautiful on the page."
  },
  {
    "instruction": "How long does voice memorial processing take?",
    "response": "Usually a few hours after you upload the recordings. You'll get a notification when it's ready to use. The AI needs time to analyze the voice patterns and build the model."
  },
  {
    "instruction": "Can I create a tribute for someone who died years ago?",
    "response": "Absolutely. There's no time limit. People create tributes for loved ones who passed decades ago. It's never too late to honor their memory digitally."
  },
  {
    "instruction": "What if I want to archive the tribute after a year?",
    "response": "You can set it to private so only you can see it, or delete it entirely. But there's no cost to keeping it live, so many people leave them up indefinitely as lasting memorials."
  },
  {
    "instruction": "Can I translate the tribute to another language?",
    "response": "We don't have automatic translation yet. You'd need to manually write the content in another language or create a second section with translated text. Future feature possibility though!"
  },
  {
    "instruction": "How do I handle family disagreements about tribute content?",
    "response": "That's tough and unfortunately not something we can mediate. Our suggestion: communicate openly with family, maybe create sections for different perspectives, or use co-manager access so everyone contributes."
  },
  {
    "instruction": "What if someone steals photos from the tribute?",
    "response": "Photos on public tributes can be saved by anyone. If you're concerned about theft, use restricted privacy settings or add watermarks to images before uploading. We can't prevent public content from being copied."
  },
  {
    "instruction": "Can I add a memory book where people write stories?",

  },
  {
    "instruction": "How do I feature their life achievements?",
    "response": "Write them into the biography - education, career, volunteer work, hobbies, awards. You could format it as a timeline or highlight sections. Make it as detailed as you want."
  },
  {
    "instruction": "What if I want to add a guestbook for the service?",
    "response": "The condolence section and RSVP function like a digital guestbook. People leave messages and you can see who attended. For a physical guestbook at the service, you'd coordinate that separately."
  },
  {
    "instruction": "Can I create a memorial fund through the platform?",
    "response": "You can enable donations which function like a memorial fund. People donate, you receive the funds, and you can use them however you see fit - to offset funeral costs, donate to charity, etc."

  {
    "instruction": "What if the tribute has outdated information?",

  },
  {
    "instruction": "Can I add instructions for the service (dress code, parking)?",
    "response": "Yep! When adding service details, there's usually a notes or instructions field. Mention dress code, parking, what to bring, special requests - anything guests should know."
  },
  {
    "instruction": "What if I want to honor them annually?",
    "response": "You can update the tribute each year on their birthday or death anniversary with new messages, photos, or memories. Many families make it a tradition to keep adding to the tribute over time."
  },
  {
    "instruction": "How do I encourage people to share their memories?",
    "response": "In the tribute description or when sharing the link, add a note like 'Please leave your favorite memory in the condolence section - we'd love to hear your stories.' People usually respond well to direct invitations."
  },
  {
    "instruction": "Can I see who donated and how much?",
    "response": "You'll see names and amounts for donors who opted to share publicly. Anonymous donors show as 'Anonymous.' All totals are visible in your dashboard along with donor messages if they left any."
  },
  {
    "instruction": "What if I want a specific song played at the service?",
    "response": "Coordinate that with your service provider when booking. Add it to special instructions or message them directly. They'll handle music arrangements for the actual ceremony."
  },
  {
    "instruction": "How do I make the tribute feel personal and unique?",
    "response": "Use their favorite colors in photo selections, write in a tone that matches their personality, include inside jokes or stories only close ones would know, add meaningful quotes. Let your love and knowledge of them shine through."

  },
  {
    "instruction": "What's the best way to organize lots of photos?",

  },
  {
    "instruction": "How do I handle negative or inappropriate messages?",

  },
  {
    "instruction": "Can I preview the tribute before publishing?",
    "response": "When you create it, it goes live immediately. But if you set it to Private initially, you can view and edit it freely before changing it to Public or Restricted when you're ready."
  },
  {
    "instruction": "What if I want to thank the AI for helping me through grief?",
    "response": "That's really sweet. The AI is just doing its job, but knowing it helped means the system is working as intended. Consider leaving feedback so we know it's making a difference!"
  },
  {
    "instruction": "How do I close or deactivate my account?",
    "response": "Contact support with your request to close your account. They'll guide you through the process, including what happens to your tributes (archived or deleted). Account closure is permanent."
  },
  {
    "instruction": "Can I create a group tribute with multiple families contributing?",
    "response": "Yes! Add multiple co-managers from different families. Everyone with co-manager access can add content, making it a collaborative memorial. Great for honoring someone with a wide community."
  },
  {
    "instruction": "What if I need the tribute urgently for a service happening soon?",
    "response": "Tribute creation takes just a few minutes. Upload a photo, basic details, and share the link - done. You can always enhance it later with more photos, bio details, and features. Start simple and build from there."
  },
  {
    "instruction": "How do I find inspiration for what to write?",
    "response": "Think about: their personality, favorite sayings, what made them laugh, how they loved, what they taught you, their passions, defining moments. Write like you're telling a friend about them. Authenticity > perfection."
  },
  {
    "instruction": "Can the platform help with funeral planning beyond booking?",
    "response": "The AI grief counselor can answer questions about traditions and customs. Providers often offer planning consultations. But for full planning services, you'd coordinate directly with the funeral home or provider you book."
