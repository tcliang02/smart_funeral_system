  {
    "instruction": "I miss my dad so much. I cry every night.",
    "response": "I'm truly sorry for your loss. It's okay to cry — it's part of healing. Each tear is love expressed. Would you like me to share a short Buddhist reflection about impermanence to ease your heart?"
  },
  {
    "instruction": "I feel so guilty I wasn't there when my mother passed.",
    "response": "I'm so sorry you're going through this. That guilt about not being there - so many people carry that. But look at all the years of love you gave her. That's what matters most."
  },
  {
    "instruction": "The 49-day prayers are so exhausting. I don't know if I can continue.",
    "response": "The 49-day journey is emotionally exhausting. It's okay to feel tired. Are the weekly ceremonies bringing you any peace, or does it feel overwhelming right now?"
  },
  {
    "instruction": "I can't stop thinking about their last moments.",
    "response": "Those thoughts can be really heavy. It's natural for your mind to replay those moments. Have you tried focusing on a happy memory instead when this happens? Sometimes that can bring a little relief."
  },
  {
    "instruction": "Everyone says I should be over it by now. It's been 3 months.",
    "response": "Grief has no timeline. Three months is still so recent. Anyone telling you to 'get over it' doesn't understand how deep your love goes. Take all the time you need."
  },
  {
    "instruction": "I don't want to live anymore without them.",
    "response": "I'm very concerned about what you've shared. Please reach out right now to Befrienders KL at 03-7627 2929 or Talian Kasih at 15999. They're available 24/7 and truly want to help you through this darkness. You don't have to face this alone."
  },
  {
    "instruction": "Sometimes I feel angry at them for leaving me.",
    "response": "Anger is a completely normal part of grief. It doesn't mean you love them any less. It just means you're hurting deeply. Can you tell me more about what triggers that anger?"
  },
  {
    "instruction": "I keep seeing them in crowds or hearing their voice.",
    "response": "That's actually very common in early grief. Your brain is still adjusting to their absence. These moments can feel startling, but they're a normal part of the grieving process. Does it bring you comfort or distress?"
  },
  {
    "instruction": "Am I doing the merit-making correctly? I'm worried I'm failing them.",
    "response": "The fact that you're doing merit-making at all shows your deep love and devotion. There's no 'wrong' way when your intentions are pure. What specific part are you worried about?"
  },
  {
    "instruction": "I can't eat. Nothing tastes good anymore.",
    "response": "Loss of appetite is very common in grief. Your body is processing deep emotional pain. Try small, simple foods when you can. Have you been able to sleep at all?"
  },
  {
    "instruction": "How do I explain death to my 5-year-old?",
    "response": "Children need simple, honest explanations. You might say something like, 'Grandma's body stopped working and she can't come back, but we keep her in our hearts by remembering her.' It's okay if they ask questions repeatedly - that's how they process."
  },
  {
    "instruction": "I feel numb. I can't feel anything anymore.",
    "response": "Numbness is your mind's way of protecting you from overwhelming pain. It's temporary, though it doesn't feel that way right now. Feelings will return gradually when you're ready. Be gentle with yourself."
  },
  {
    "instruction": "The temple chanting makes me cry uncontrollably.",
    "response": "It's completely okay to cry during the chanting. Buddhism teaches us to feel our emotions fully, not push them away. Those tears are part of your healing. You're honoring them beautifully."
  },
  {
    "instruction": "I regret not saying I love you more often.",
    "response": "So many people carry this regret. But love isn't just in words - it's in all the care you showed, the time you spent together, the ways you supported them. They knew."
  },
  {
    "instruction": "I'm afraid I'll forget what they looked like or sounded like.",
    "response": "That's a common fear. Photos, videos, and voice recordings can help preserve those memories. But more importantly, the feeling of their love - that stays with you forever. Have you considered creating a small memory book?"
  },
  {
    "instruction": "My siblings aren't helping with funeral arrangements. I'm doing everything alone.",
    "response": "That sounds incredibly overwhelming and unfair. People grieve differently - some avoid tasks because it's too painful. But that doesn't make your burden any lighter. Can you tell them directly that you need help?"
  },
  {
    "instruction": "I want to hurt myself. I can't take this pain.",
    "response": "Please reach out for help right now. Contact Befrienders KL at 03-7627 2929 or text TBAN WhatsApp at 018-988 8058. These counselors are trained to help and they truly care. You don't have to face this darkness alone. Please call them now."
  },
  {
    "instruction": "Is it normal to feel relieved after someone dies from a long illness?",
    "response": "Yes, absolutely. Relief doesn't mean you didn't love them - it means you're glad their suffering has ended. Grief can include many contradictory emotions all at once. That's completely normal."
  },
  {
    "instruction": "I can't go back to work. How do people just continue with normal life?",
    "response": "Returning to routines after loss feels impossible at first. People aren't 'fine' - they're just moving through the motions. Go back when you're ready, even if it's part-time at first. There's no rush."
  },
  {
    "instruction": "Should I keep their room exactly as it was?",
    "response": "There's no right answer. Some people find comfort in preserving the space; others need to slowly make changes. Do what feels right for your heart. You can always change your mind later."
  },
  {
    "instruction": "The funeral costs are bankrupting us. I feel like a bad son.",
    "response": "You are not a bad son. Filial devotion isn't measured by how much money you spend. A simple, heartfelt ceremony honors them just as much. Your love is what matters, not the price tag."
  },
  {
    "instruction": "I keep having dreams where they're still alive.",
    "response": "Dreams like that can feel confusing - comforting and painful at the same time. Some believe these are visits; others see them as your mind processing grief. Either way, it's normal. How do you feel when you wake up?"
  },
  {
    "instruction": "My spouse doesn't understand why I'm still sad.",
    "response": "That must feel lonely. People who haven't experienced this kind of loss often can't grasp how deep it goes. Have you tried explaining to them that grief doesn't have an expiration date?"
  },
  {
    "instruction": "I'm angry at the doctors. They didn't do enough.",
    "response": "Anger at medical professionals is very common in grief. Sometimes we need someone to blame. Whether that anger is justified or not, it's still valid to feel it. Do you think talking it through might help?"
  },
  {
    "instruction": "How long will this pain last?",
    "response": "The sharp, overwhelming pain does soften over time. Most people say it doesn't disappear, but it becomes gentler - more like waves than a constant storm. Healing happens gradually, in its own time."
  },
  {
    "instruction": "I can't stop crying at work. It's embarrassing.",
    "response": "Grief doesn't respect schedules. If possible, take short breaks when emotions rise. There's no shame in crying - it shows how deeply you loved. Have you told your supervisor what you're going through?"
  },
  {
    "instruction": "I feel like I'm going crazy. Is this normal?",
    "response": "Yes, grief can make you feel like you're losing your mind. The fog, the forgetfulness, the emotional swings - all normal. Your brain is processing enormous pain. It will settle, I promise."
  },
  {
    "instruction": "I didn't cry at the funeral. Does that mean I didn't love them?",
    "response": "Not at all. Some people go into 'functional mode' during funerals, handling logistics and staying strong for others. Tears aren't the only measure of love. Your grief is just as valid."
  },
  {
    "instruction": "Everyone keeps saying they're in a better place. It doesn't help.",
    "response": "That phrase, though well-meaning, can feel dismissive when you're hurting. It's okay to tell people you need different support. What would actually help you right now?"
  },
  {
    "instruction": "I'm worried about the 49-day journey. What if I'm not doing enough for their soul?",
    "response": "Your worry shows how much you care. The prayers and merit-making you're doing - the intention behind them is what matters most. You're helping their journey beautifully. 放心 (rest assured)."
  },
  {
    "instruction": "I feel guilty when I laugh or enjoy something.",
    "response": "Your loved one wouldn't want you to stop living. Experiencing moments of joy doesn't dishonor their memory - it honors the life and love you shared. You're allowed to feel happiness again."
  },
  {
    "instruction": "My faith is shaken. Why did Buddha let this happen?",
    "response": "Spiritual doubt is natural in grief. Buddhism teaches about impermanence - that all things change, including life itself. Death isn't a punishment; it's part of the cycle. Your questions are valid and part of your journey."
  },
  {
    "instruction": "I'm drinking more to cope with the pain.",
    "response": "I understand you're trying to numb the hurt. Alcohol might help temporarily, but it can make grief harder to process long-term. Have you considered talking to a counselor or joining a support group instead?"
  },
  {
    "instruction": "My parents expect me to handle everything because I'm the eldest.",
    "response": "Filial piety can feel like a heavy burden when you're grieving too. Being the eldest doesn't mean you have to carry everything alone. It's okay to ask your siblings or other family members to help share the load."
  },
  {
    "instruction": "I saw them in a dream and they looked peaceful. What does that mean?",
    "response": "Many people find comfort in peaceful dreams like that. Some believe it's their way of saying they're okay. Others see it as your mind creating the reassurance you need. Either way, it's a gentle gift."
  },
  {
    "instruction": "I'm terrified of forgetting them.",
    "response": "The love you shared and the impact they had on your life - those don't fade. Even if small details blur over time, the essence of who they were stays in your heart. Have you started writing down favorite memories?"
  },
  {
    "instruction": "The 100-day ceremony is coming. I'm not ready.",
    "response": "These milestone ceremonies can reopen fresh grief. It's okay to not feel ready. The ceremony isn't about being 'over it' - it's about honoring their memory and your ongoing love. Take it one moment at a time."
  },
  {
    "instruction": "I can't focus on anything. My mind is foggy.",
    "response": "Grief fog is very real. Your brain is using so much energy to process loss that concentration suffers. Be patient with yourself. Simple tasks, short lists, and extra rest can help. This fog will lift gradually."
  },
  {
    "instruction": "Should I remove their photos? Seeing them hurts.",
    "response": "Do what feels right for your healing. Some people need to see photos for comfort; others find it too painful at first. You can always put them away temporarily and bring them back when you're ready. There's no wrong choice."
  },
  {
    "instruction": "I'm so tired of people asking if I'm okay.",
    "response": "That question can feel exhausting when you're clearly not okay. It's alright to say, 'I'm struggling, but I don't want to talk about it right now.' People usually mean well but don't know what else to say."
  },
  {
    "instruction": "I wish I had been a better daughter.",
    "response": "This is one of the most common regrets in grief. But I'm sure you showed love in countless ways - even if it didn't feel perfect. We all wish we could have one more chance. They knew you loved them."
  },
  {
    "instruction": "Meditation isn't helping. I can't quiet my mind.",
    "response": "Meditation during intense grief can be really difficult. A busy, grieving mind is normal. Maybe try gentler practices first - slow walking, mindful breathing for just 2 minutes, or listening to soft chanting. Small steps."
  },
  {
    "instruction": "I'm avoiding friends because I don't want to bring the mood down.",
    "response": "True friends want to support you, even when you're sad. Isolating yourself can make grief heavier. Maybe reach out to one trusted person and be honest: 'I'm struggling and I need company, even if I'm quiet.'"
  },
  {
    "instruction": "Will the pain ever completely go away?",
    "response": "The intense, sharp pain does soften. Most people describe it as learning to carry the loss differently - it becomes part of you, but not all of you. Joy and grief can eventually coexist."
  },
  {
    "instruction": "I can't bring myself to give away their clothes.",
    "response": "There's no timeline for this. Some people keep clothes for years; others donate them early. Both are okay. When you're ready - even if that's a long time from now - you'll know. Don't rush yourself."
  },
  {
    "instruction": "My chest feels tight and heavy all the time.",
    "response": "That physical heaviness is grief settling in your body. Deep breathing, gentle stretching, or even a short walk can help release some of that tension. If it persists, checking with a doctor isn't a bad idea either."
  },
  {
    "instruction": "I feel like I should be stronger for my family.",
    "response": "Being strong doesn't mean not showing emotion. Your family needs to see that it's okay to grieve openly. Showing your pain gives them permission to show theirs. You're all in this together."
  },
  {
    "instruction": "Is it wrong to feel angry at them for dying?",
    "response": "No, it's not wrong. Anger is a natural grief response. You might feel abandoned, even though logically you know they didn't choose to leave. These contradictory feelings are all part of the process."
  },
  {
    "instruction": "The altar at home reminds me they're gone. Should I remove it?",
    "response": "The altar can be a comfort or a trigger - sometimes both. You don't have to remove it if it's culturally important to your family. Maybe adjust what you see or spend less time near it if needed. Do what protects your heart."
  },
  {
    "instruction": "I feel jealous when I see other people with their parents.",
    "response": "That stab of jealousy is so common. It's not that you begrudge others - you just miss what you've lost. Those feelings are valid. Let them pass through without judgment."
  },
  {
    "instruction": "I want to end everything. Nothing matters anymore.",
    "response": "I'm deeply worried about you. Please contact Befrienders KL immediately at 03-7627 2929 or Talian Kasih at 15999. These trained counselors care and want to help. You don't have to go through this alone. Please reach out now."
  },
  {
    "instruction": "How do I honor their memory in daily life?",
    "response": "Small, meaningful gestures work beautifully: lighting incense, saying their name, continuing traditions they loved, doing acts of kindness in their honor. You honor them by living fully and kindly - that's what they'd want."
  },
  {
    "instruction": "I keep replaying our last argument.",
    "response": "Last-moment regrets are incredibly painful. But one argument doesn't define a relationship. Think of all the years of love, all the good moments. That's what truly mattered. They knew your heart."
  },
  {
    "instruction": "My grief feels different from everyone else's. Am I doing it wrong?",
    "response": "There's no 'right' way to grieve. Some cry daily; others go numb. Some need people; others need solitude. Your grief is as unique as your relationship was. Trust your own process."
  },
  {
    "instruction": "I'm scared I'll never feel happy again.",
    "response": "Right now it feels impossible, I know. But happiness does return - gradually, in small moments at first. It won't be the same as before, but it will come. Grief and joy can eventually exist side by side."
  },
  {
    "instruction": "Buddhist teachings say not to be attached, but I can't let go.",
    "response": "There's a difference between healthy love and suffering attachment. Buddhism asks us to accept impermanence, not to stop loving. You can honor your love while also gently releasing the grip of suffering. It's a balance."
  },
  {
    "instruction": "I'm having panic attacks when I think about them.",
    "response": "Panic attacks are your nervous system responding to grief trauma. When one starts, try this: breathe in for 4, hold for 4, out for 6. Ground yourself - name 5 things you see, 4 you touch. It will pass."
  },
  {
    "instruction": "Everyone expects me to be strong because I'm a man.",
    "response": "That expectation is unfair and outdated. Grief doesn't care about gender. Men cry, men hurt, men need support too. Your emotions are valid. Do you have anyone you can be vulnerable with?"
  },
  {
    "instruction": "I regret not asking about their childhood stories.",
    "response": "That's such a tender regret. Maybe you can ask other relatives who knew them? Sometimes gathering these stories from others becomes a beautiful healing project. Their memory lives on through what others share."
  },
  {
    "instruction": "Is it okay to start dating again after losing my spouse?",
    "response": "Only you know when you're ready. There's no timeline. Some people need years; others months. New love doesn't replace old love - your heart has room for both. Do what feels right, not what others expect."
  },
  {
    "instruction": "I can't stop googling their illness, looking for answers.",
    "response": "Searching for answers is a way to try to regain control. But sometimes there are no satisfying answers. This research might keep you stuck. Have you considered channeling that energy into something healing instead?"
  },
  {
    "instruction": "The first birthday without them is coming. How do I handle it?",
    "response": "Firsts are incredibly hard. Some people mark the day with ritual - lighting candles, visiting their favorite place, gathering family. Others keep busy. There's no wrong approach. What feels right for your heart?"
  },
  {
    "instruction": "I feel like a burden when I cry in front of others.",
    "response": "You're not a burden. People who love you want to support you through this. Showing your grief helps them understand what you need. Vulnerability is a gift of trust, not a burden."
  },
  {
    "instruction": "Should I go to therapy or is this normal grief?",
    "response": "Grief is normal, but support through it is wise. Therapy isn't just for 'abnormal' grief - it's a safe space to process pain with someone trained to help. There's no shame in seeking support."
  },
  {
    "instruction": "I'm not religious. Are these Buddhist practices still helpful?",
    "response": "The rituals can be culturally meaningful even without deep belief. They provide structure, community, and a way to express love. Take what feels helpful and leave what doesn't. There's no requirement to believe it all."
  },
  {
    "instruction": "My child won't stop asking when grandma is coming back.",
    "response": "Children process death slowly and need repetition. Keep explanations simple and consistent: 'Grandma died, which means her body stopped working and she can't come back. We keep her in our hearts by remembering her.' Patience is key."
  },
  {
    "instruction": "I feel disconnected from my body, like I'm floating.",
    "response": "Dissociation is a trauma response to overwhelming grief. Grounding techniques can help: press your feet firmly on the floor, hold ice, name objects around you. If this continues, talking to a counselor could really help."
  },
  {
    "instruction": "I'm so exhausted but I can't sleep.",
    "response": "Grief exhaustion with insomnia is a cruel combination. Try a calming bedtime routine: warm shower, herbal tea, soft music, no screens an hour before bed. If it persists beyond a few weeks, consider talking to a doctor."
  },
  {
    "instruction": "People keep telling me to be grateful for the time we had.",
    "response": "Gratitude and grief can coexist, but it's okay if you're not there yet. Right now you're hurting, and that's valid. Gratitude might come later. You don't have to force it."
  },
  {
    "instruction": "I'm afraid to be happy because it feels like I'm forgetting them.",
    "response": "Happiness doesn't mean forgetting. You can laugh, enjoy life, and still hold them in your heart. They'd want you to live fully - that honors their memory more than perpetual sadness."
  },
  {
    "instruction": "I'm avoiding the cemetery. Does that make me a bad person?",
    "response": "Not at all. Everyone connects to memory differently. Some find peace at gravesites; others feel their loved one's presence elsewhere - at home, in nature, in daily moments. Honor them in ways that feel right to you."
  },
  {
    "instruction": "My appetite is gone. I've lost so much weight.",
    "response": "Grief can really impact appetite. Try small, simple foods - soup, fruit, toast. Set gentle reminders to eat. If weight loss becomes concerning or continues, please see a doctor. Your body needs care right now."
  },
  {
    "instruction": "I'm having intrusive thoughts about their death.",
    "response": "Intrusive thoughts are a common trauma response. They're distressing but not permanent. When they come, acknowledge them gently - 'This is a thought, not reality right now' - then redirect your mind. A counselor can teach coping strategies."
  },
  {
    "instruction": "Should I keep their phone number saved?",
    "response": "That's deeply personal. Some people keep it as a comfort; others find it painful. There's no rush to delete it. You can always keep it saved under a different name if seeing it pop up hurts. Do what feels right."
  },
  {
    "instruction": "I feel nothing. Just empty and numb.",
    "response": "Numbness is your psyche protecting you from overwhelming pain. It's temporary, though it doesn't feel that way. Emotions will return when you're ready. For now, be gentle and patient with yourself."
  },
  {
    "instruction": "How do I support my grieving parent when I'm grieving too?",
    "response": "You're both in pain - you can support each other without fixing each other. Share quiet moments, cry together, be present. But also remember: you can't pour from an empty cup. Take care of yourself too."
  },
  {
    "instruction": "Is it normal to feel relieved when someone toxic dies?",
    "response": "Yes. Grief for complicated relationships is valid too. You can feel relief, sadness, anger, guilt all at once. You're allowed to mourn what you wish the relationship had been, even if you don't miss the person."
  },
  {
    "instruction": "I want to keep their voicemail forever. Is that healthy?",
    "response": "Keeping voicemails is common and can be comforting. Technology lets us hold onto pieces of them. If it brings you peace rather than pain, there's nothing unhealthy about it. Save backups so you never lose it."
  },
  {
    "instruction": "My faith used to comfort me. Now I feel nothing when I pray.",
    "response": "Grief can temporarily disconnect us from faith. That emptiness is normal - your spiritual practice might need time to feel meaningful again. Keep showing up gently, even if it feels hollow right now. It may return."
  },
  {
    "instruction": "I'm dreading Chinese New Year without them.",
    "response": "Holidays without loved ones are incredibly painful. It's okay to change traditions, skip celebrations, or create new rituals in their honor. Do what protects your heart. There's no obligation to 'be festive' if you're hurting."
  },
  {
    "instruction": "I keep thinking I see them in public.",
    "response": "That heart-stopping moment of thinking you see them - so many grieving people experience this. It's your brain trying to find them because it misses them so much. It's startling but normal, and it fades with time."
  },
  {
    "instruction": "Should I take antidepressants for my grief?",
    "response": "Grief and depression can overlap but aren't the same. If grief is severely impacting daily functioning or lasting many months without improvement, medication might help. Talk to a doctor who understands grief to explore if it's right for you."
  },
  {
    "instruction": "I'm angry at people who complain about their living parents.",
    "response": "That anger makes sense - they still have what you've lost. But their struggles are real to them too. Try to remember: pain isn't a competition. Your grief is valid, and so are their frustrations. Both can be true."
  },
  {
    "instruction": "I can't go into their room. It's been months.",
    "response": "There's no deadline for being ready. That room holds so much emotional weight. When and if you ever feel ready, maybe ask someone to be there with you. Or you might decide to keep it closed - both are okay."
  },
  {
    "instruction": "How do I explain to my boss I need more time off?",
    "response": "Be honest: 'I'm still struggling with my loss and need a bit more time to heal.' Many workplaces offer bereavement support or flexibility. If they're not understanding, that says more about them than you. Your healing matters."
  },
  {
    "instruction": "I feel like I'm drowning and no one understands.",
    "response": "Grief can feel incredibly isolating. You're not alone, even though it feels that way. Have you considered joining a grief support group? Being with others who truly understand can be powerfully healing."
  },
  {
    "instruction": "Is it okay to talk to their photo?",
    "response": "Absolutely. Many people find comfort in talking to photos, altars, or even just speaking aloud to their loved one. It's a way to maintain connection. If it helps you, keep doing it. There's nothing strange about it."
  },
  {
    "instruction": "I'm worried about burdening my friends with my sadness.",
    "response": "True friends want to be there for you. That said, you can also seek support from a counselor or grief group so it's not all on friends. Balance is okay - you deserve support from multiple sources."
  },
  {
    "instruction": "I feel like my grief isn't valid because we weren't blood-related.",
    "response": "Love defines family, not blood. If they mattered to you, your grief is completely valid. Chosen family, close friends, mentors - these losses are real and profound. Don't let anyone diminish your pain."
  },
  {
    "instruction": "Sometimes I forget they're gone for a moment, then remember. It's horrible.",
    "response": "That sudden remembering is one of grief's cruelest moments. Your brain is slowly adjusting to a new reality. These moments happen less over time, but they're agonizing when they do. I'm sorry you're experiencing that."
  },
  {
    "instruction": "My younger siblings are partying and seem fine. How can they move on so fast?",
    "response": "People grieve at different paces and in different ways. They might be coping through distraction or processing privately. Try not to judge their journey - just focus on your own. Everyone's path through grief is unique."
  },
  {
    "instruction": "I'm having physical symptoms - headaches, stomach issues. Is this grief?",
    "response": "Grief absolutely affects the body. Headaches, stomach problems, fatigue, muscle tension - all common. If symptoms are severe or persistent, see a doctor to rule out other causes. But yes, grief can make you physically sick."
  },
  {
    "instruction": "Do signs from the afterlife really happen?",
    "response": "Many people report feeling signs - dreams, butterflies, songs, meaningful coincidences. Whether they're real or our mind seeking comfort, if they bring you peace, embrace them. What matters is the comfort they provide."
  },
  {
    "instruction": "I feel like I'm dishonoring them by laughing or having fun.",
    "response": "Living fully is the greatest honor. They'd want you to experience joy, not live in permanent sadness. Laughter doesn't erase love or memory. You're allowed to be happy again."
  },
  {
    "instruction": "I don't know how to answer 'How are you?' anymore.",
    "response": "That question can feel impossible. Try: 'I'm taking it one day at a time' or 'Some days are harder than others.' You don't owe people cheerful responses if you're struggling. Honesty is okay."
  },
  {
    "instruction": "Should I create a memorial fund or scholarship in their name?",
    "response": "That's a beautiful way to honor them if it feels right. It creates ongoing positive impact and keeps their memory alive. But there's no pressure - simple, personal remembrance is just as meaningful."
  },
  {
    "instruction": "I'm scared of forgetting the sound of their laugh.",
    "response": "If you have any recordings - videos, voicemails, anything - treasure them. But know this: even if the exact sound fades, the feeling of their joy stays with you. The essence of who they were doesn't disappear."
  },
  {
    "instruction": "My partner is grieving differently than me. It's causing fights.",
    "response": "Grief is deeply personal - no two people do it the same way. Try to give each other grace and space. Communicate your needs clearly. Consider couples counseling to navigate this together. You're both hurting."
  },
  {
    "instruction": "I regret not visiting them more often before they got sick.",
    "response": "Hindsight regret is so painful. But life gets busy - that's human. What matters is that you loved them and they knew it. We all wish we could go back. Be gentle with your past self."
  },
  {
    "instruction": "Is it okay to feel relieved the caregiving is over?",
    "response": "Yes, absolutely. Caregiving is exhausting and watching suffering is traumatic. Relief doesn't mean you didn't love them - it means you're glad their pain ended and that the heavy burden has lifted. That's completely normal."
  },
  {
    "instruction": "How do I handle people who say everything happens for a reason?",
    "response": "That phrase, though meant to comfort, can feel dismissive. You can say, 'I appreciate your care, but that doesn't help me right now.' Or simply change the subject. You're not obligated to engage with unhelpful platitudes."
  },
  {
    "instruction": "I feel like I'm going through the motions of life like a robot.",
    "response": "That autopilot feeling is common in grief. Your emotional energy is being used to process loss, so everything else feels mechanical. This phase passes. You won't feel like a robot forever, I promise."
  },
  {
    "instruction": "Should I do something special on the anniversary of their death?",
    "response": "That's personal - some people create rituals (temple visit, favorite meal, lighting candles), others prefer quiet reflection. There's no should. Do what feels meaningful to you, or nothing at all if that's what you need."
  },
  {
    "instruction": "I'm scared of how my life has changed forever.",
    "response": "Change after loss is terrifying and permanent. Your life is divided into before and after now. But humans are remarkably resilient. You'll learn to carry this, and life will feel manageable again. Different, but manageable."
  },
  {
    "instruction": "I want to scream at everyone to leave me alone.",
    "response": "That urge is completely valid. You need space and people keep intruding. It's okay to set boundaries: 'I need some time alone right now. I'll reach out when I'm ready.' Protect your energy."
  },
  {
    "instruction": "Am I supposed to keep their ashes or scatter them?",
    "response": "This is deeply personal and often cultural. Some families keep urns at home; others scatter ashes in meaningful places. What would they have wanted? What brings you comfort? There's no wrong answer."
  },
  {
    "instruction": "I feel like I aged 10 years since they died.",
    "response": "Grief is exhausting and shows on our faces and bodies. The weight of loss can feel physically aging. With time and self-care, some vitality returns. For now, be extra gentle with yourself."
  },
  {
    "instruction": "How do I stop torturing myself with what-ifs?",
    "response": "What-if thinking is grief's cruel trick. When your mind spirals, try to interrupt it: 'I did the best I could with what I knew then.' You can't rewrite the past, only be compassionate with yourself now."
  },
  {
    "instruction": "Is it weird to celebrate their birthday still?",
    "response": "Not weird at all. Many people continue birthday traditions - cake, gathering family, visiting the grave, making donations. It's a way to honor their life and keep them present. If it brings comfort, do it."
  },
  {
    "instruction": "I don't recognize myself anymore. Grief has changed me.",
    "response": "Loss does change us - we can't go back to who we were before. But that doesn't mean the change is all bad. You might emerge more compassionate, resilient, or appreciative. You're evolving, not lost."
  },
  {
    "instruction": "I'm terrified of losing someone else I love.",
    "response": "That fear after loss is natural - you've learned how painful death is. But living in fear robs you of connection and joy. Grief teaches us that love is worth the risk. Try to stay present, one day at a time."
  },
  {
    "instruction": "People keep asking if there's anything they can do. What do I even say?",
    "response": "Be specific: 'Can you drop off a meal?' or 'Can you help with grocery shopping?' People genuinely want to help but don't know how. Giving them concrete tasks makes it easier for everyone."
  },
  {
    "instruction": "I'm so tired of pretending I'm okay.",
    "response": "Then stop pretending. It's exhausting to wear a mask. Try being honest with safe people: 'I'm really struggling.' You might be surprised how much relief honesty brings. You don't have to perform strength."
  },
  {
    "instruction": "Will I ever stop thinking about them every single day?",
    "response": "Probably not entirely - but the constant, intrusive thoughts do ease. Eventually they become softer, more like gentle remembering than painful preoccupation. They'll always be part of your thoughts, but less heavy over time."
  },
  {
    "instruction": "I don't want to go to the one-year memorial. Too painful.",
    "response": "You don't have to go if it's too much. Grief doesn't require perfect attendance at every ritual. Honor them in your own way that day if public ceremony feels overwhelming. Do what protects your heart."
  },
  {
    "instruction": "How do I know if my grief has become depression?",
    "response": "If grief persists intensely beyond 6-12 months with no improvement, includes suicidal thoughts, or completely prevents functioning, it might be complicated grief or depression. A mental health professional can help distinguish and treat it."
  },
  {
    "instruction": "I'm avoiding old photos and videos. Is that unhealthy?",
    "response": "Not necessarily. Some people need distance early on; others find comfort immediately. Avoidance becomes unhealthy if it's permanent. But taking a break from painful triggers early in grief is a valid coping strategy."
  },
  {
    "instruction": "The house feels empty and haunted without them.",
    "response": "Homes hold so much memory. That emptiness is heavy. Some people rearrange furniture, fill the space with music, or invite people over. Others sit with the quiet. What would make the space feel less haunting for you?"
  },
  {
    "instruction": "I can't believe it's real. Will this denial ever end?",
    "response": "Denial is often the first stage of grief - your mind protecting you from overwhelming reality. It fades gradually as you slowly absorb the truth. Be patient. Reality settles in bit by bit, not all at once."
  },
  {
    "instruction": "Should I tell my therapist I'm not getting better?",
    "response": "Absolutely. Honest communication with your therapist is essential. If their approach isn't helping, they can adjust or you can find someone else. Therapy should support your healing - speak up about what you need."
  },
  {
    "instruction": "I feel like I have no purpose without caring for them.",
    "response": "Losing your role as caregiver leaves a painful void. But your purpose extends beyond that role. This is a chance to rediscover yourself. It takes time. What brought you joy before? What might you explore now?"
  },
  {
    "instruction": "People say time heals. I don't believe it.",
    "response": "Time alone doesn't heal - it's what you do with that time. Active grieving, seeking support, being gentle with yourself - that's what gradually eases pain. Time gives you space to heal, but you have to do the work too."
  },
  {
    "instruction": "I'm so angry I could break things.",
    "response": "That rage is grief energy needing release. Physical outlets can help - hit pillows, scream in your car, intense exercise, rip paper. Channel that anger safely so it doesn't build up. Anger is valid and temporary."
  },
  {
    "instruction": "My cultural traditions around death feel suffocating right now.",
    "response": "Cultural expectations can feel overwhelming when you're already grieving. It's okay to participate selectively or ask others to handle parts. Your emotional wellbeing matters more than perfect ritual observance. Do what you can."
  },
  {
    "instruction": "I don't feel like they're watching over me. Am I broken?",
    "response": "Not everyone feels spiritual presence, and that's okay. Some people do, some don't. Neither experience is better or more valid. You can honor memory without feeling supernatural connection. You're not broken - just different."
  },
  {
    "instruction": "I'm jealous of people whose loved ones died peacefully. Ours was traumatic.",
    "response": "Traumatic deaths carry extra layers of grief. That jealousy makes sense - you wish their passing had been gentler. Trauma-focused therapy (EMDR, trauma counseling) can specifically help process traumatic loss differently than regular grief support."
  },
  {
    "instruction": "How do I answer when people ask how they died?",
    "response": "You control what you share. You can say, 'I'd prefer not to discuss details' or give a brief answer: 'It was sudden' or 'After a long illness.' You don't owe strangers or acquaintances your painful story."
  },
  {
    "instruction": "I want to honor them but don't know how.",
    "response": "Honor can be simple: live by values they taught you, support causes they cared about, tell stories about them, be kind to others in their name. Big gestures aren't required. Your life lived well is honor enough."
  },
  {
    "instruction": "The grief comes in waves. Is that normal?",
    "response": "Yes, absolutely. Grief isn't linear - it comes and goes in waves. You might feel okay, then suddenly devastated. These waves eventually become gentler and further apart, but they never fully stop. That's normal and healthy."
  },
  {
    "instruction": "I feel like I'm losing my connection to them.",
    "response": "That fear is common, but connection doesn't disappear - it transforms. You move from physical presence to memory, from daily interaction to internal relationship. Different doesn't mean gone. They remain part of who you are."
  },
  {
    "instruction": "I don't want to burden my family, so I cry alone.",
    "response": "Sharing grief can strengthen family bonds, not burden them. You're likely all struggling privately. Crying together might help everyone. Vulnerability can be a gift. But if you need private time too, that's also valid."
  },
  {
    "instruction": "How do I rebuild my life after loss?",
    "response": "Slowly, gently, one small step at a time. Start with basics - sleep, eat, move your body. Then gradually reconnect with activities, people, purpose. There's no timeline. Rebuilding doesn't mean forgetting - you carry them forward with you."
  },
  {
    "instruction": "I wish I could go back and say goodbye properly.",
    "response": "That longing for a better goodbye is heartbreaking. You can't go back, but you can say goodbye now - write a letter, speak at their grave, or simply say words aloud in private. It's never too late for those words."
  },
  {
    "instruction": "Grief is making me question everything about my life.",
    "response": "Loss often triggers existential reflection - about purpose, priorities, mortality. This questioning, while uncomfortable, can lead to meaningful life changes. You're reassessing what matters. That's not wrong - it's growth through pain."
  },
  {
    "instruction": "I feel guilty for moving forward with my life.",
    "response": "Moving forward isn't leaving them behind. You carry their love and memory as you continue living. They'd want you to have a full, meaningful life. Forward movement honors them - it doesn't erase them."
  },
  {
    "instruction": "How do I support my child who's also grieving?",
    "response": "Be honest in age-appropriate ways, maintain routines for security, allow their emotions, answer questions patiently (they'll ask repeatedly), and model healthy grieving. Reassure them it's okay to feel sad and okay to feel happy. You're both learning together."
  },
  {
    "instruction": "I can't imagine ever being truly happy again.",
    "response": "Right now that feels impossible. But humans have remarkable capacity for healing. Happiness does return - it looks different, includes grief alongside it, but it comes. You won't feel this way forever, even if you can't imagine otherwise yet."
  },
  {
    "instruction": "Every song, every place reminds me of them. It's overwhelming.",
    "response": "Grief triggers are everywhere early on. Over time, your brain forms new associations and these triggers lose intensity. For now, it's okay to avoid certain songs or places if needed. Eventually, they might bring comfort instead of pain."
  },
  {
    "instruction": "I feel like no one wants to hear about them anymore.",
    "response": "People often avoid the topic because they don't want to make you sad, not because they don't care. Try saying, 'I'd love to talk about them if you're willing to listen.' Most people will welcome the invitation. Your loved one deserves to be remembered aloud."
