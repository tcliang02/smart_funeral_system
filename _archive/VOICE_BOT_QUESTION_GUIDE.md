## 🚀 Why This Works

### **The Science:**
**AI learns from patterns.** The more specific and repeated the input, the better the output.

**Bad training data:**
> "They were kind"

**Good training data:**
> "When I was sad, they'd say 'Come here, tell mama what happened' and make me hot Milo. Every single time."

### **The Psychology:**
Specific questions trigger specific memories. "Tell me about your dad" is too broad. "What did your dad say when you came home late?" unlocks a memory.
