- **7 Service Providers** (people who would manage funeral businesses, packages, bookings)
- **5 Funeral Attendees** (people who would RSVP, offer flowers/candles, view tributes)

### Sample Invitation Message:
```
Hi [Name],

I'm conducting a usability evaluation for my FYP project - a Smart Funeral Management System.

Could you please:
1. Access the system at [YOUR URL] for at least 30 minutes
2. Try different features (booking, tributes, virtual offerings, etc.)
3. Complete this short survey: [YOUR FORM LINK]

It will take about 3-5 minutes after exploring the system. Your feedback is greatly appreciated!

Thank you!
[Your Name]
```

## AFTER COLLECTING 20 RESPONSES

### Calculate SUS Scores

1. Open your response spreadsheet
2. For each respondent, calculate their SUS score:

**Formula:**
```
For Questions 3, 5, 7, 9, 11 (odd): score = response - 1
For Questions 4, 6, 8, 10, 12 (even): score = 5 - response
SUS Score = (sum of all 10 scores) × 2.5
```

**Example:**
If someone answered: 4, 2, 5, 1, 4, 2, 4, 1, 5, 2

Odd questions: (4-1) + (5-1) + (4-1) + (4-1) + (5-1) = 3+4+3+3+4 = 17
Even questions: (5-2) + (5-1) + (5-2) + (5-1) + (5-2) = 3+4+3+4+3 = 17
Total: 17 + 17 = 34
SUS Score: 34 × 2.5 = **85**

3. Calculate averages by role:
   - Family Members average (8 people)
   - Service Providers average (7 people)
   - Attendees average (5 people)
   - Overall average (20 people)

4. Update Chapter 6 Table 6.28 with your actual results

## QUICK REFERENCE: The 10 SUS Questions (Copy These EXACTLY!)

1. I think that I would like to use this system frequently
2. I found the system unnecessarily complex

⚠️ **DO NOT CHANGE THESE WORDINGS - SUS requires exact phrasing!**

## COMMON MISTAKES TO AVOID ❌

1. ❌ Changing the wording of SUS questions (invalidates the methodology)
2. ❌ Using a scale other than 1-5 (breaks SUS calculation)
3. ❌ Wrong labels (must be "Strongly Disagree" to "Strongly Agree")
4. ❌ Making optional questions required (will frustrate respondents)
5. ❌ Forgetting to update URL/email placeholders
6. ❌ Not testing the form before distributing
7. ❌ Distributing to wrong number of people per role (need 8/7/5 split)
8. ❌ Letting people fill out form without using the system first

## NEED HELP?

If you get stuck while creating the form:
1. Check this guide again
2. Refer to the detailed `SUS_QUESTIONNAIRE_GOOGLE_FORM.md`
3. Google "how to create linear scale in Google Forms"
4. Make sure each SUS question is a separate question (not a grid/matrix)

Good luck creating your form! 🎉
