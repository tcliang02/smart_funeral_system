DATA FLOWS FROM SYSTEM TO EXTERNAL ENTITIES:
To Customer/Family:
- User Profile
- Tribute Page
- Booking Confirmation
- Payment Receipt

To Service Provider:
- Provider Dashboard
- Booking Notifications
- Review Summary
- Customer Information

To Guest Visitor:
- Tribute Display

STYLING:
- External entities: Light green (#D4EDDA) with dark green border (#28A745)
- Central system: Light blue (#D1ECF1) with dark blue border (#0C5460)
- Arrows: Solid black lines with arrowheads
- Labels: Small text on arrows describing data flow
- Layout: Circular arrangement with system in center
```

## ✨ SIMPLIFIED PROMPT (If AI rejects the above)

```
Create a context diagram showing:

Center: "Smart Funeral Management System" (blue rectangle)

External entities (green rounded rectangles):
- Customer/Family (top-left)
- Service Provider (top-right)  
- Guest Visitor (bottom-left)
- Payment Gateway (bottom-center)
- Email System (bottom-right)

Draw arrows between external entities and the central system showing data flows.
Use a clean, professional layout with the system in the center.
```

## 📝 STEP-BY-STEP MANUAL DRAWING

If you prefer to draw manually instead of using AI:

### Step 1: Create Central System (2 minutes)
1. Insert Rectangle shape
2. Type: "Smart Funeral Management System"
3. Resize to ~300px wide × 150px tall
4. Apply blue styling (colors above)
5. Position in center of canvas

### Step 2: Create External Entities (5 minutes)
1. Insert 5 Rounded Rectangles
2. Label each:
   - Customer/Family
   - Service Provider
   - Guest Visitor
   - Payment Gateway
   - Email System
3. Resize each to ~180px wide × 80px tall
4. Apply green styling (colors above)
5. Arrange around central system

### Step 3: Add Data Flows (10 minutes)
1. Use Connector tool (not Line tool)
2. Draw arrows from entities to system
3. Draw arrows from system to entities
4. Add text labels to each arrow
5. Adjust arrow routing for clarity

### Step 4: Fine-tune Layout (3 minutes)
1. Align entities symmetrically
2. Distribute spacing evenly
3. Ensure no overlapping arrows
4. Center the entire diagram

**Total Time: ~20 minutes**

## ✅ VERIFICATION CHECKLIST

Before finalizing, check:
- [ ] Central system is in the middle
- [ ] 5 external entities present
- [ ] All entities use correct colors
- [ ] Arrows point in correct directions
- [ ] All arrows have text labels
- [ ] No overlapping elements
- [ ] Professional appearance
- [ ] Consistent font sizes

---

## 💡 TIPS FOR BEST RESULTS

1. **Start Simple:** Let AI create basic structure first
2. **Then Style:** Manually apply colors and formatting
3. **Space Evenly:** Use Lucidchart's alignment tools
4. **Group Arrows:** Bundle similar data flows together
5. **Use Layers:** Put arrows on separate layer if needed
6. **Export:** Save as PNG (300 DPI) for documentation

---

## 🎯 EXPECTED OUTPUT

Your final Context Diagram should show:
- **1 system** (blue rectangle in center)
- **5 external entities** (green rounded rectangles around it)
- **~25-30 labeled arrows** showing all major data flows
- **Clean, professional layout** suitable for academic submission

**Good luck with your Context Diagram! 🎨**
